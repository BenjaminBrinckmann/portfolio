I have written and illustrated a book together with my father that will be published by Uitgeverij Noordboek in the Netherlands. The book is about what we, as dutchmen, can learn from the Norwegian outdoorlife-traditions (called Friluftsliv) and how we can use that knowledge within the dutch landscape. 
The book has 54 illustrations and this is one of them. The folklore of the troll is a perfect depiction of the unpredictabilty of the norwegian nature. Made with pen.
