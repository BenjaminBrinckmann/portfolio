A digital artwork as an entry for an online competition. The theme being "Monster battles". The design had to incorporate organic and mechanical elements. I have always been fascinated by dinosaurs and I still find the Tyrannosaurus Rex to be one the most awesome creatures. The only thing I had to compensate for were his small arms, which I did, using giant robotic claws. In the end I managed to capture my boyhood fascinations quite well.
