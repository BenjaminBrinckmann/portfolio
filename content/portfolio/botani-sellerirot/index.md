This illustration is part of a series that has been used for information signs for CSA's(Community Supported Agriculture) in Norway. I've designed, written (with help) and illustrated all of these signs. They have been sold to CSA's all over Norway. As of yet, there are 29 signs in total and you can see them all on my homepage: [brinckmann.no](https://brinckmann.no/). The signs have yet to be translated to other languages. You can also buy a high quality print of this one, size A4.
