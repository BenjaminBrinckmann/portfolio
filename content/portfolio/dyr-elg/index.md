This is a practice drawing where I repainted a painting by prof. Richard Friese(1854-1918); a german artist who was exceptionally skilled at painting animals. In his lifetime animal-paintings were seen as low art so he never gained much notoriaty except for within the hunters community. My great grandfather was a big admirerer of his work and Friese's paintings have been in my family ever since. 
The practice was to make this digital artwork in only four shades of grey with no textures.
