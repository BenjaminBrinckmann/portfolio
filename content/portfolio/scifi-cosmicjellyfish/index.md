A digital artwork as an entry for an online competition. The theme was humanity 500 years into future as inspired by the recent SpaceX launched. 
I chose to focus on the human emotion of awe and wonder for our universe. I tried to evoke curiosity through this image, not only for outer space, but also for our own planet and the alien lifeforms that we find here on our home planet.
