I have written and illustrated a book together with my father that will be published by Uitgeverij Noordboek in the Netherlands. The book is about what we, as dutchmen, can learn from the Norwegian outdoorlife-traditions (called Friluftsliv) and how we can use that knowledge within the dutch landscape. 
The book has 54 illustrations and this is one of them: a digital painting where I try to convey how I experienced being completely engulfed by a snowstorm in the high mountains of Norway.
