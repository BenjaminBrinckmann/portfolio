A digital artwork of a traditional dutch canal boat called a "Pot". It was very shallow boat that could traverse the rivers and creeks between the Netherlands and Germany. 
It was meant as part of a website advertising touristtrips with a reconstructed "Pot", but ended up with using a photograph instead.
