A watercolour illustration of oyster mushrooms. This is a commission for the Museums in Akerhus, Oslo. The illustration is placed on a similar information sign as I have made for the other vegetables, and placed at the oyster mushroom farm in their botanical garden. It is [gruten.no](https://www.gruten.no/) that takes care of the mushroom farm.
