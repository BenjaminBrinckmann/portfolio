A digital painting where I tried to express the feeling of dissapointment whenever I was met with human marks on the landscape whenever I was travelling in the wilderniss. However, as I was working with it it started to take on a whole other meaning and symbolism to me. I think I leave it up to the viewer to make up their own opinion of this piece.
