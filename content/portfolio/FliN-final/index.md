So it is finally printed and in stores! The book that my father and I have written together describing Norwegian outdoorlife (called friluftsliv) to the Dutch. The book is illustrated with 54 helpful drawings that I have made and some of them you can see here on my webpage. The cover art I did not make, by the way. The book is published by Uitgeverij Noordboek.
