A digital illustration of a stone age(mesolithic timeperiod) who travels in a dugout canoe during in rainy weather. He has a short unexpected encounter with a deer that is equally surprised. This painting was to convey the magic one can experience while canoeing in the rain. You might get wet and cold, but the sound of the rain on the water is soothing and the misty clouds keep revealing more beauty.
