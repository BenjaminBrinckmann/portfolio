The sailors of the traditional dutch canal boat, called the "Buurser Pot" –who take tourists on trips on the "buurser beek" in Haaksbergen, the Netherlands– have started a local microbrewery and asked for a ftting pubsign. The pubsign depicts the boat and the beer. The sailor is also holding a so called "Kroef" in his left hand, which is a tool that is being used in the local irrigation techniques. Made digitally.
